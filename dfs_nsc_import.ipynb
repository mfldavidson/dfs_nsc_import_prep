    "# Prepare an NSC Data Return File for Import into DRDFS Salesforce\n",
    "[Detroit Regional Dollars for Scholars](https://drdfs.org/) gets data from the National Student Clearinghouse on its alumni outcomes using the [StudentTracker service](https://www.studentclearinghouse.org/colleges/studenttracker/). This program takes a file returned from NSC as input, manipulates the data into the format needed to import it into DRDFS's student information system (Salesforce CoPilot), and outputs a file ready to be imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of records produced from the NSC Data:\n",
    "1. A Standard Academic Semester record of a student enrolled at a particular school in a particular semester\n",
    "1. A Degree record of a student earning a degree at a particular school on a particular date\n",
    "1. A No Enrollment Academic Semester record that no record was found for a student by the NSC\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input (Files Needed)\n",
    "- `NSC_Return.csv` = The exact file returned by the NSC.\n",
    "- `schools_to_replace.csv` = A file of some schools' NSC and IPEDS names. School names in Salesforce are sourced from IPEDS and don't always neatly match the same school's name as reported by the NSC. Thus, this file provides a convenient way to store known NSC Name to IPEDS name mappings to use to streamline merging in the schools data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "- `NSC_Import_Academic_Semesters.csv` = The Standard Academic Semesters file that is ready to be imported into Salesforce.\n",
